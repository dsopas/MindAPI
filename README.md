## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://dsopas.github.io/MindAPI/)

I'm a huge fan of mindmaps! ðŸŒŸ They're my go-to for keeping my thoughts organized whether I'm deep in security research or bouncing ideas around with my colleagues. Inspired by this, I wanted to share the love with the community, so I created MindAPI.

In today's world, APIs are the backbone of pretty much every modern app out there. So, I thought, why not make something that not only aids the security community in assessing APIs but also keeps my own work neat and tidy? It's the best of both worlds!

MindAPI it's divided into two sections:

- Reconnaissance
- Testing (Covers most of [OWASP API Security Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-api-security/) and other security resources)

On both of them you have guidelines, links to open-source tools and documentation that help you on the way.

### Built With

The project was built with the help of:
* [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)
